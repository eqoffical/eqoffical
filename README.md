- 👋 Hi, I’m **eq**
- 👀 Be careful, there are some repositories with **low quality code**, I just don't have time to update and clean everything. Ideally, it would be great to rewrite these repositories with my current knowledge and add a release, but I don't know when I will do it or if I will do it at all
- 🌱 I’m ~~currently learning~~ Python and GDScript, also occasionally work with AutoHotkey scripts
- 💞️ ~~I’m looking to collaborate on ...~~
